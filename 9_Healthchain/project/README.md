About the project: With an ever-increasing population, the number of diseases is also increasing in today's world. Every year, approximately 60% of the population is diagnosed with a variety of health problems. 
As a result, the number of health records is growing, some of which are stored digitally and others physically. 
Maintaining a personal health record for an individual can also be time-consuming, as it runs the risk of being misplaced or damaged.
 Our project  focuses on making the entire process more convenient for patients and healthcare providers by digitising it. 
It focuses on converting all health records into Electronic Health Records (EHR) and storing them on blockchain because it saves money and improves performance. 
Healthchain is a platform that digitalizes the entire patient experience, from health records to medical bill payments, all in one place. 
Healthchain also provides doctors with information about the patient's medical history.
